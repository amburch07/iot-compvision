# Progress Updates (3/11 - 4/5)

## Week 1 (3/11 - 3/15)

### What did your team do last week?
* Set up repository
* Identified deliverables
* Made plan
* Obtained hardware (Webcam, Raspberry Pi)
* Tested camera with Python script
* Started building a flowchart/breakdown of all of the parts of our project and how they connect

### What will you do this week?
* Researched Python packages and tutorials (ex OpenCV)
* Researched website hosting options (IBM Cloud Node Red, Docker)
* Researched working with Raspberry Pi (ssh, camera hookup, LEDs)
* Configure Raspberry Pi
* Start working on preprocessing and classification algorithms

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* Getting LED Lights to simulate door locking/unlocking
* Figure out how to dynamically change webpage with server updates (do we need to reload page?)

---------------------------------------------------------

## Week 2 (3/18 - 3/22)

### What did your team do last week?
* Redesigned network components to reflect plans for web hosting, hardware, and client-server interactions
* Began work on website design/implementation
* Began web-server code
* Setup and configured Raspberry Pi (SSH)
* Finished sending and receiving images over TCP


### What will you do this week?
* Continue front-end of website, start on networking back-end
* Work on pre-processing algorithms
* Work on computer-vision classification algorithms
* Work on server code
* Hookup Raspberry-Pi camera and LEDs
* Use FTP to to send images from Pi to server

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* We slightly redesigned out networking components to make sure they were a sufficiently large part of our project

----------------------------------------------------------

## Week 3 (3/25 - 3/29)

### What did your team do last week?
* Used FTP to send a stream of images between computers
* Began work on image pre-processing and computer vision algorithms
* Began work on front-end of website

### What will you do this week?
* Finish webcam server, image pre-processing server, and web server
* Integrate image pre-processing and computer vision code with server code
* Begin work on back-end of website (Display live images from camera, alert user when person is detected, create database of people allowed to enter)

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* Figure out how to make a web-page dynamic (Be updated with live information/alerts without refreshing)
