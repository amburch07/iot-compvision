# IoT Computer Vision Networking App
---

## What
- A webcam that streams a live feed and can send the user a notification if it detects motion or people.

## Why
- Home security remains an important issue. Recently, for example, there have been several cases of thieves stealing packages from peopleâ€™s porches and front doors. A security camera can help to keep a log of who enters or approaches a home.

## How
- A development board such as a Raspberry Pi/Pi Zero W can be used as a server which streams a live feed and sends notifications to a client.

## Deliverables
1. Network App (IoT Computer Vision)
2. Documentation


## Plan
| **Week** | **Tasks** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Week 1 | First progress report, research/literature review, get hardware/prototype, begin networking components |
| Week 2 | Networking components, begin application side, research web deployment |
| Week 3 | Work on application (Machine learning/computer vision), work on network components |
| Week 4 | Complete application, complete network, test, fix bugs |
| Week 5 | Fix bugs, Presentation, Code on GitHub/Documentation, Demo |

## Getting Started

### Install
1. Check Python requirements (see requirements.txt)
2. Install `brackets` application

### Run
1. On command prompt/terminal, cd into `ProcessingServer/src` subfolder for `ProcessingServer.py`
2. On second command prompt/terminal, cd into `CameraServer` subfolder for  `WebSocketServer.py`
3. On third prompt/terminal, again cd into `ProcessingServer/src` subfolder for `objectDetectionTest.py`
4. Download `Brackets` application and open `Web` subfolder in application
5. Run `ProcessingServer.py` (for Mac/Linux use sudo python3, for Windows, py)
6. Run `WebSocketServer.py`
7. Run `objectDetectionTest.py` to jumpstart python3 app (you won't need it after that)
8. Go to brackets open index.html from left sidebar. Click lightening icon on right side.

## Notes

If you are on a Mac or Linux and running the program multiple times, run `sudo lsof -i :21`, and `sudo lsof -i :5678`, collect the PIDs, and run `sudo kill -9 _PID_`
